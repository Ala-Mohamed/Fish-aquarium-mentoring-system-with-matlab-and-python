# Fish Aquarium Monitoring System  

## **Abstract**  
Ensuring the survival and well-being of fish in fish farms or aquariums requires effective monitoring systems. This project focuses on developing a comprehensive monitoring system to maintain optimal aquatic conditions and promote fish health. The system emphasizes both behavioral analysis and environmental parameter measurement.  

It consists of two main parts:  
1. **Image Processing-Based Fish Behavior Analysis**  
   - Uses techniques like contrast adjustment, XOR image conversion, denoising, and object spotting.  
   - Applies mathematical concepts such as matrices, vectors, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and geometric transformations.  
   - Helps interpret fish health and behavior patterns to aid better care decisions.  

2. **Environmental Parameter Monitoring**  
   - Utilizes hardware sensors including pH sensors and DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensors connected to a NodeMCU.  
   - Performs real-time data acquisition, linear regression analysis, and visualization.  
   - Facilitates timely adjustments to water quality and temperature, ensuring a healthy aquatic environment.  

The integration of these approaches provides a robust system for maintaining optimal conditions and understanding fish behavior, contributing to sustainable aquarium management.

## **Introduction**  
Monitoring a biological system in a fish aquarium involves detecting changes that could affect the health of aquatic life. This project employs mathematical applications and image processing techniques to analyze and monitor key parameters such as pH, temperature, and fish movement.  

The setup includes:  
- **Sensors**: pH sensors and DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensors connected via NodeMCU.  
- **Data Modeling**: Linear regression applied to model the relationship between pH, temperature, and fish activity.  
- **Image Processing**: Webcam captures frames that are processed to detect fish movement using XOR conversion, denoising, and object spotting.  

By analyzing sensor data alongside visual cues, the system offers insights into the health of the aquatic ecosystem, allowing for informed interventions to maintain optimal conditions.
